# <project>/.claude/skills/resumasher for project-scope — see README).
# It sets up the Python virtual environment and installs dependencies in
# place. No copying, no moving.
#
# Usage:
#   git clone https://github.com/earino/resumasher.git <target-dir>
#   bash <target-dir>/install.sh          # runtime deps only (for students)
#   bash <target-dir>/install.sh --dev    # + pytest/jupyter (for contributors)
#
# After this runs, restart Claude Code to pick up the skill.

This is almost always a network issue, not a bug in resumasher. Try:

  1. Re-run the installer — transient PyPI slowness is common:
       bash $SCRIPT_DIR/install.sh

  2. If you're on slow wifi (coffee shop, hotel, conference), bump
     pip's tolerance and retry:
       PIP_OPTS="--default-timeout=300 --retries=10" bash $SCRIPT_DIR/install.sh

  3. If you're behind a corporate proxy, set HTTPS_PROXY before running:
       export HTTPS_PROXY=http://your.proxy:port
       bash $SCRIPT_DIR/install.sh

  4. Still failing? Open an issue with the full pip output:
