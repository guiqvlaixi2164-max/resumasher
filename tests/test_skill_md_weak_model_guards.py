"""SKILL.md prescriptions added in response to weak-model failure modes
observed under qwen3.6-35b on OpenCode (run ses_236d, issue #53 spike).

Each test pins one specific guidance string in SKILL.md so future edits
that drop the guidance fail loudly in CI rather than silently regressing
to the broken state. The bugs themselves were:

1. Phase 0 first-run setup wrote `cat > .resumasher/config.json` without
   a prior `mkdir -p .resumasher/` — the parent directory doesn't exist
   on a fresh student folder, so the redirect failed (`zsh: no such file
   or directory: ...`) and the orchestrator continued with an empty config.

2. Phase 2 cache-the-summary attempted `FOLDER_SUMMARY='...Ana\\'s capstone...'`
   — single-quoted shell strings cannot contain a literal `'` (no `\\'`
   escape inside `'...'`), so zsh died with `unmatched '` and `cache.txt`
   never got written. Fit-analyst then crashed with `FAILURE: ... requires
   variable 'folder_summary'`. Heredoc with a quoted delimiter is immune.

Same root-cause class as issues #44/#45/#46/#50 — SKILL.md prescribes a
shell pattern that didn't survive contact with real sub-agent text.
